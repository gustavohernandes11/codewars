/* 
DESCRIPTION:
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
*/
function arrayDiff(initialArray = [], itemsToBeRemoved = []) {
	let newArray = initialArray.filter((e) => !itemsToBeRemoved.includes(e));
	return newArray;
}

console.log(arrayDiff([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2]));
